
This program runs a game of hangman. A judge facilitating the game and guessing selects if they will choose a word or take the harder route of generating a random string. Increase in difficulty will allow for more turns.

In order to replicate this program, do the following: 
    -Install Visual Studio Code
    -Install Python and Github extensions
    -Sign-in and connect to an existing Github account and repository
    -Import the random, string and time libraries
    -Ask for the user's name (the person or people guessing), then use the time function to create a delay, at the end of the delay the judge will select a choice of selecting their own word, or to have a random string generated. 
    -If a random string is to be generated, the judge will select the length of the string. 
    -At this point, some guidelines on rules and how to play are displayed
    -Players will input single characters, if the character is not in the string, the number of turns is decremented, at 0 turns the player loses, and the word is displayed.
    -If players win, display a congrats and end program
